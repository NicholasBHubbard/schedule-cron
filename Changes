  ("Crash scheduling empty queue") and #68533 ("Thou shalt not REAP
  what thou has not forked...") provided by tlhackque. Thanks a lot!
- New options:
  * loglevel: Tuning of logoutput.

1.00        2010-05-14

- Fix for RT #54692 occured when removing an entry.
- Fixed #55741 with help from Clinton Gormley (a perl bug occuring when

- Further bug fixes.

0.99        2009-09-12

* lib/Schedule/Cron.pm: Fixed issue for certain timeszone (like PST8PDT) where
  a backward DST switch make Cron.pm running amok by firing each job triggered
  in the extra hour without a delay between. Thanks A LOT to Eric Wilhelm for
  spotting and analysing this issue.

0.98        2009-04-03

- New option 'after_job' for new() which allows for a callback run after a job
  has been sucessfully run (RT #29040).
- Argument logging is done using data dumper (RT #39499).
- Private methods are now marked with '_'.
- Added tests for increased kwallitee.
- Switched over to Build.PL (Makefile.PL is still supported).
- Fixed some time calculation times (e.g. for the first DST switch in the
  year). 
- Allow comments at the end of a crontab line.
* lib/Schedule/Cron.pm (_calc_time): fixed some issues when calculating times
  for '*' entries.
* t/execution_time.t: Added test for checking proper DST behaviour.
* lib/Schedule/Cron.pm (load_crontab): Allow comment at the end of a crontab
  line.

0.97        2006-11-27

- Use POSIX only where available, otherwise fallback to an emulation of waipid.
- Fixed bug when previous SIGCHLD handler was not a coderef, but a tring value
  like "DEFAULT" or "IGNORE"
- Added tests
- Made test more robust so they work now also on system without alarm()
  functionality (Win32).
- Cron.pm:(run): Removed leading space when no process prefix is used (for
  backwards compatibility).

0.96        2006-11-05

- Applied patch for #4917 in order to be smarter to existing SIGCHLD handler
  and to reap only own childs.

0.95        2006-11-05

- If a scheduled method in 'nofork' manipulates the execution queue with 
  add_entry or delete_entry, it will be picked up during the next run. 
- Clarified different behaviour of global variables within the fork/nofork mode
  in the documentation.
- Fixed warning about non-numeric arguments when sorting. 
- Fixed bug which called to an undefined methods in a die-message
- Pretty print a hashref in $0 if provided as argument and the 
  prefix for the name to be shown in the process list can be configured
  with the option "processprefix".
- CHANGES: added patches and suggestions from
  - Andrew Danforth
  - Frank Mayer
  - Jamie McCarthy
  - Andy Ford
- Cron.pm: Worked on: Reexamination of crontabs entry in 'nofork' mode if
  someone has added a new entry.

0.9         2005-01-03

- Logging: It is now possible to add a reference to a custom logging
  subroutine to the constructor which will be used for logging certain
  events.
- NoFork: The option 'nofork' prevents Cron.pm from creating a new child
  process. Instead, the job is run within the current process. You can use the
  'skip' and 'catch' options to tune the behaviour.
- Cron.pm: added new options 'nofork', 'skip', 'catch' and 'log'.
- t/entry.t (Module): added and extended tests.
- Cron.pm (add_entry): added heuristic for parsing crontab with 6 time columns.
- (get_next_execution_time): allow a sixth column for specifing the second to
  start up.
- Cron.pm:(get_next_execution_time): added recognition of "*/5" notations
  (thanks to Loic Paillotin for spotting this problem).

0.05        2002-04-02

- Other bugfixes for parsedate problem with single digit hours/minutes 
  and warnings if argumentlist of command to execute is empty.
- Cron.pm: added patch from Lars Holokowo for working around a bug in
  parsedate, which has trouble in parsing times in the form "3:1 2000/6/30".
  Added tests to check for those dates.
- Cron.pm: added additional check for arguments to avoid warnings as suggested
  by David Parker.
- Makefile.PL: added check for Time::ParseDate as suggested by
  Philippe Verdret.

0.03        2000-06-12

- Cron.pm: Fixed bug in regexp splitting the crontab entry in
  get_next_execution_time() report by Peter Vary.
- Cron.pm: Fixed problem when reaping childs: Now SIGCHLD handler can handle
  more than one finished child at once (thanx to Bray Jones for discovering
  this bug).

0.01        2000-01-09

- Initial Release
